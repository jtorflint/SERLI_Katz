# Introduction ##############################

The data analyized in this project is from a larger set taken by Dr P Katz in the late 1990's. A group of children (*n=108*) were given the measurement at 60 and 72 month mark, however (*number*) only completed the measure at the 72 month mark. 

# Hypothesis ################################
## H1###############################  
Children's SERLI scores will differ between the 60 month mark and the 72 month mark. 

##H2######################   
there will be some interaction between child's awareness of gender steryotypes (p1) and their preferences (p2)
